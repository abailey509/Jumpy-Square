# Jumpy-Square
A simple game in Python using Pygame

Begin by installing Python and the Python module Pygame 

Set up Development Enviroment by doing the following:
1. Download all files in Repo
2. Place Danse-macabre.mp3 in a folder called "music"
3. run Jumpy Square

The primary parts of the Pygame module used was the Rect function that is used to draw simple rectangles
and allows for the use of Colliderect which automatically handles collision detection.
the rectangle function is actually used to draw the floor, walls, and player.


I found the following resources to be invaluable during development:

Too many videos to count found here: https://www.youtube.com/
